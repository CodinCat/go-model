Robust & Easy to use model mapper and model utility methods for Go. Typical method(s) increases productivity and makes Go developement more fun :)

go-model tested with Go `v1.2` and above.

**Development is in progress :)**

## Features
Will describe in detail after initial release. I'm sure it will be very helpful, since its born from typical need while developing Go application and utility.

<!-- ## Installation

#### Stable - Version
Please refer section [Versioning](#versioning) for detailed info.

```sh
# install the library
go get gopkg.in/jeevatkm/go-model.v0
```

#### Latest
```sh
# install the latest & greatest library
go get github.com/jeevatkm/go-model
```

## Usage
Import go-model into your code and refer it as `model`.
```go

  "gopkg.in/jeevatkm/go-model.v0"
)
``` -->

## Versioning
go-model releases versions according to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org)

`gopkg.in/jeevatkm/go-model.vX` points to appropriate tag versions; `X` denotes version number and its a stable release. It is recommended to use version, for eg. `gopkg.in/jeevatkm/go-model.v0`. Development takes place at the master branch. Althought the code in master should always compile and test successfully, it might break API's. We aim to maintain backwards compatibility, but API's and behaviour might be changed to fix a bug.
 
## Contributing
Welcome! If you find any improvement or issue you want to fix. Feel free to send a pull request, I like pull requests that include tests case for fix/enhancement. Did my best to bring pretty good code coverage and feel free to write tests.

BTW, I'd like to know what you think about go-model. Kindly open an issue or send me an email; it'd mean a lot to me.
